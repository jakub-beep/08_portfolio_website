      <p>Project "Simulations" consists of the simulations I've performed during
        my time as a mechanical designer. There are here strength linear as well
        non-linear simulations of frames, roll-cage, underground reservois and
        car suspension.</p>

      <h2><span>Motivation</span></h2>
      <p>
        My first project connected with simulations was designing bike frame with
        necessary tests which happened to be my engineers thesis.
        As a suspension member in PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS I've been busy with suspension
        designing which included simulations connected with car behaviour on the
        road, which was necessary to design safe suspension. Moreover those researches
        and roll cage tests were part of my master thesis.
        As a mechanical designer during my job I've used to test underground reservois
        and frames to design the the lightest and the strongest reservois.
