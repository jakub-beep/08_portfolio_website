      <p>Project "Roll Cage" was designed to provide safety for passengers of
        Solar Car "Klara". Its main purpose is to ensure the safety of the
        occupants during the use of the vehicle, especially during collisions.
        It is a steel, welded frame that covers the entire passenger
        compartment.

      <h2><span>Motivation</span></h2>
      <br>
      <p>As a member of PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS and a master in enginnering to be
        I've been looking for main project for my master thesis. During our
        preparations for a tournament we found out that according to its
        regulations we had to enforce our safety structures to participate in
        race. Because I've already had experience in FEA calculations and CAD
        modelling I've decided that I will do it.
