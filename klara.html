      <p>Project "Klara" is being realised within structures of Pozna≈Ñ University
        of Technology from 2016. The main goal of this student's organization is
        to desing and build solar cars.</p>
      <br>
      <h2><span>My contribution</span> to the project</h2>
      <br>
      <p>My journey with PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS started in 2019 when my friend told
        me that he is about to join some great science organisation, so I had to
        find out something more about that. I went to their workshop to just chat
        and well I stayed for years and even now after graduating I am still trying
        to help a little bit!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Firstly I was one of <span>mechanical designers</span> responsible for
        designing roll cage and parts of suspension. Later I've become
        <span>leader</span> of mechanical department and I was taking care of
        managing all mechanical members, recruiting new members, writing reports,
        making balance sheet and prognosis for future. And now as a graduate I am
        helping with some mechanical projects and <span>creating website</span>
        for our organization.
