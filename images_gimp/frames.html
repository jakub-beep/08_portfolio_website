      <p>Project "Frames" aim was to design way of mounting suspension to body
        of the solar car "Klara". Althoug our body car made through lamination
        process and consists of carbon there was no way to prove strength of the
        body so the decision was made to create steel frames. In this way we got
        very safe steel structures.

      <h2><span>Motivation</span></h2>
      <br>
      <p>As a member of PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS and a master in enginnering to be
        I've been taking part in process of suspension design. One of my first
        assignments was to design way of mounting suspension to body of the car.
        Moreover it was a viable part of my master thesis.
